# AntWar
Small indie game
This game has a lot of features that I want to develop.
The idea is simple, You gonna have your anthill and you have to upgrade it, you gonna be able to upgrade your ants, your anthill's rooms
and that's not all, because, there'es gonna be enemies, red ants. The red ants going to attack your anthill constantly and
they don't just want to kill and steal, they want to eslave your larvae. 
The objective is: destroy the enemie's anthill
